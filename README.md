# Restaurant Page

This is a **restaurant page** project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal of this project is to practice **DOM manipulation** by dynamically rendering content on a webpage using only JavaScript, while maintaining a clean separation of concerns by utilizing a separate CSS file for styling.

The site features multiple "tabs," including **Home**, **Menu**, and **About**, each dynamically created by JavaScript, and it is structured using modules for modularity and maintainability.

You can view the live version of the project [here](https://dlastic.github.io/odin-restaurant-page/).

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: The website content is generated entirely through JavaScript, with each tab (Home, Menu, About) stored in separate modules.
- **Tab Navigation**: Users can switch between tabs (Home, Menu, About) by clicking buttons in the navigation bar, with each tabâ€™s content dynamically loaded into the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a pleasant experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Custom styling.
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, module pattern, and event handling to dynamically create and switch between tabs.
